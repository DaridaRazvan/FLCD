I could not find "==" in the operators list, or any equality replacement
a2a is a possible identifier, which I do not believe is ok
LIDENTIFIER looks like a typo
Inside the ifstmt, you could put the else between []

This is my review. My name is David Catalin-Ioan from group 932/2. The rest looks really good!
